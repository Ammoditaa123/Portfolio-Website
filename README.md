My Personal Portfolio Website

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website\! This site is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The primary goal was to create a **clean, professional, and fully responsive** user experience across all devices.

The website is built entirely using **vanilla front-end technologies**: HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, demonstrating a strong grasp of fundamental web development principles.

## 🚀 Features

  * **Clean and Modern Design:** Focus on simplicity and readability with consistent color schemes and typography.
  * **Fully Responsive Layout:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing using CSS Flexbox and Media Queries.
  * **Interactive Skills Section:** Displays my core competencies, including front-end development and design skills.
  * **Smooth Navigation:** Implements **smooth scrolling** for an enhanced user experience when navigating between sections.
  * **Dark Mode Toggle (Bonus):** A user-activated toggle for switching between light and dark themes, demonstrating dynamic CSS styling with JavaScript.
  * **Static Contact Form:** A form layout to gather visitor information (static, no backend included).
